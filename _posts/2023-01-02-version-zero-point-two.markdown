Version 0.2 is entirely text based. It is playable at [version 0.2][v0.2-release]. Or rather barely playable, since it is difficult to make it clear what to do in a text-based game, and the player easily goes wandering aimlessly.

This version tests the story and lore. Before making any kind of graphics, a text-based version of the game may reveal problems with the story that a story-based game would have. This version definitely reveals some issues with the story. Forcefully attempting to send a message seems to open up too many plotholes. Is there a way to let events unfold more naturally?
