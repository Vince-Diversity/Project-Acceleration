The majority of games on the internet seem to follow the same set of story formulas. When it comes to small, indie-developed story-rich games, they are about overcoming fears, fighting for justice and expressing idealized amounts of love and friendship. More recent games are frequently tragic, overcoming oneself in different ways and are very inclusive to non-convetional themes.

There seems to be a non-conventional theme that still seems to be missing. It is about a strange sense of alienation that never goes away, combined with irrational solidarity and unconditional support.

The basic setting of the story is a new student who is received by a delegated mentor to a boarding school, in a world where magic and science coexist. In a conventional game, the player would be a new student who discovers old secrets and tries to uncover them, because secrets strengthens the role of a protagonist and give the player an incentive to progress; but in this game the player is the mentor, the non-player characters do a lot to story progress without the player's knowledge and, most experimentally, characters do not keep secrets from the player. There is no need to make the player search for answers, if the answers are very hard to believe. This story is about blindly trusting someone, only because nobody else would.

The story was trialed in version 0.2. It was too incoherent. So instead of a written manuscript, the story will be improvised as the game is being made. If the story does not reach any particular end through improvisation, so be it. The story can be improvised again. It seems fitting to iterate different coherent story paths until the real ending is found.
