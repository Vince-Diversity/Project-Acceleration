Stories in games seem to follow the same set of formulas. For small, indie-developed games, they are about overcoming fears, fighting for justice and expressing idealized amounts of love and friendship. More recent games are frequently tragic, overcoming oneself in different ways and often adding elements to support societal diversity.

Something is still missing. It is about a strange sense of alienation that never goes away, combined with irrational solidarity and unconditional support.

The basic setting of the story is a new student who is received by a delegated mentor to a boarding school, in a world where magic and science coexist. Characters do not keep secrets from the player. There is no need to make the player struggle for answers. Because the answers are not meant to be believed, not until the story progresses. This story is about blindly trusting someone, only because nobody else would.

The story was trialed in version 0.2. It was too incoherent. So instead of a written manuscript, the story will be improvised as the game is being made. If the story does not reach any particular end through improvisation, so be it. The story can be improvised again. Gradually iterating on different story paths until the real ending is found.
