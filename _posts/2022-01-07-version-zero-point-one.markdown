The purpose of version 0.1 is to test an RPG gameplay concept. It is playable at [version 0.1][v0.1-release].

Having searched around the internet, there seems to be a lack of games with the following traits:
* The player character is frequency given attention in the battle. For example, the battles could be spectated by story-relevant NPCs. Allies and enemies could comment on the flow of the battle.
* The narrative is entertaining. To enable this, the story needs to allow many quirky characters who all contribute meaningfully. A hero-centered story often only has room for stereotypical archetypes.
* The reason for a battle should not be made in hindsight. Many battles in RPGs are forced constructs that make little sense in a point of a story. Also, such attempts often desperately try to moralize violence in the story.
* Progression can not only rely on gaining stats from leveling. The game should not be a repetitive level race between the player and next boss objective. For this reason, the game developer should really question the point of increasing stats when leveling up.

To satisfy these traits, something new needs to be tested. Having now concept tested a gameplay and story setting, it was found to be difficult to develop a turn-based gameplay that is scalable enough to last a full game. So for the future versions of the game, does a game that satisfy above traits really need combat gameplay? This question will be answered for future versions.
