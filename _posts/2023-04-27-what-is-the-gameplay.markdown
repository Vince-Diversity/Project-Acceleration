What differentiates a book from a story-driven video game? When reading a book, the reader is actively imagining the visuals and the sounds. A video game is, as the name implies, more like a video of a story that unfolds. This allows the player to be active in other things than imagining. In a game, the player engages in trying to win in some way.

But what about a visual novel, where there is not much gameplay? These games embrace the idea of branching dialogues and storylines, and finding the "true ending" could be considered a sense of achievement.

But branching storylines are a means to an end. There are many problematic examples where a branching scenario seems questionable or where the player is forced to the same ending anyways and it becomes an illusion of choice.

So what kind of game would it be, without branching storylines, and without things like puzzles or boring fetch quests? Is it even a game anymore, or more like a video tape with lots of manual effort?

The "gameplay" idea of this project will not force out-of-place puzzles, it just takes programming effort for little thematic value. It will, hopefully, solve the dilemma of having player engagement in a different way. The idea will be called "story-driven gameplay". The story determines what the gameplay will be like. This will not conflict any pre-written storyline, actually, [there is none][tin]. There story may even be influenced by what gameplay seems fitting. In this game, the introductory story is about a new student who is introduced by a mentor to a boarding school. The story-driven gameplay can then be to explore the school to show the new student, interact with objects to explain them and talk to NPCs to introduce them. The gameplay is to think about what a good mentor would do. But unlike a simulation game, where the player is awarded for performing the task well, a role-playing game puts the sense of achievement on just being able to experience the story advance, allowing tasks to be done in less optimal ways just because the player wants to imagine the story that way, like when reading a book spaced with missing words, sentences and pages, letting the player engage in filling those spaces in.
