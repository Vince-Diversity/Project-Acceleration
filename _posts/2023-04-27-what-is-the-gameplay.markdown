What differentiates a book from a story-driven video game? When reading a book, the reader is actively imagining the visuals and the sounds. A video game is like playing a video for the player, but more importantly is that the player engages in trying to win in some way.

But what about a visual novel, where there is not much gameplay? These games instead have branching dialogues and storylines, and finding the "true ending" could be considered winning. But there are many problematic examples where a branching scenario seems questionable or where the player is forced to the same outcomes anyways and it becomes an illusion of choice.

So what kind of game would it be, without branching storylines, and without puzzles or boring fetch quests? Is it even a game anymore?

The "gameplay" idea of this project is inspired by Yume Nikki. All gameplay is about dreamwalking. It is barely a game. And even less a visual novel. Just an interactive book, but with a twist: you might find some useful items. Roller skates to make move around faster. Wings to explore more freely. Lenses to view the world differently.
