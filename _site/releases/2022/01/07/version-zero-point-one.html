    <p>The purpose of version 0.1 is to test an RPG gameplay concept. It is playable at <a href="https://github.com/Vince-Diversity/Project-Devotion/releases/tag/v0.1">version 0.1</a>.</p>

<p>Having searched around the internet, there seems to be a lack of games with the following traits:</p>
<ul>
  <li>The player character is frequency given attention in the battle. For example, the battles could be spectated by story-relevant NPCs. Allies and enemies could comment on the flow of the battle.</li>
  <li>The narrative is entertaining. To enable this, the story needs to allow many quirky characters who all contribute meaningfully. A hero-centered story often only has room for stereotypical archetypes.</li>
  <li>The reason for a battle should not be made in hindsight. Many battles in RPGs are forced constructs that make little sense in a point of a story. Also, such attempts often desperately try to moralize violence in the story.</li>
  <li>Progression can not only rely on gaining stats from leveling. The game should not be a repetitive level race between the player and next boss objective. For this reason, the game developer should really question the point of increasing stats when leveling up.</li>
</ul>

<p>To satisfy these traits, something new needs to be tested. Having now concept tested a gameplay and story setting, it was found to be difficult to develop a turn-based gameplay that is scalable enough to last a full game. So for the future versions of the game, does a game that satisfy above traits really need combat gameplay? This question will be answered for future versions.</p>

        <p>In a three-dimensional space, acceleration is the rate of velocity. Time is a fourth dimension in the theory of relativity. Thus, acceleration can also be imagined as the rate of time. This is the origin behind the name of this project.</p>
