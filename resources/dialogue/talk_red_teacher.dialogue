{{red_teacher}}: Hope you are fired up for some battle practice this term!
{{green}}: Actually, I'm not so fond of that.
{{red_teacher}}: Think about it! Your friend {{red}} would need someone as dedicated as you to spar with.
{{green}}: {{blue}}, this is {{red_teacher}}. She is the main teacher of {{red_aspect}} magic but she also manages magical martial arts training.
