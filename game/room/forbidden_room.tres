The team is in a small study room. There is a big book in the center.
{{GREEN}}: \"The Forbidden Knowledge\", the title says. Written by {{BLUE_FATHER}}.
{{BLUE}}: That is my father's book!
{{GREEN}}: Really? Should I read out loud?
{{BLUE}} becomes awfully quiet suddenly.
{{RED}}: {{GREEN}}, I do not have a good feeling about this title. Are you sure you want to read it?
But {{GREEN}} had already started looking at the introduction. Surprisingly, the ink on the pages seems to be moving. Nonetheless, {{GREEN}} tries to read it.
{{GREEN}}: The...
When {{GREEN}} reads the first words, the following words start to become more clear.
{{GREEN}}: \"The Forbidden Knowledge is a warning. A warning to all foolish people who attempt to get a glimpse of their future. The future must remain a forbidden knowledge, to preserve reality as we know it.\"
{{GREEN}}: See? I think there's nothing to worry about!
{{GREEN}} turns a few pages. But no matter what page they are on, the ink reshapes and continues on the same sentence that {{GREEN}} had been reading!
{{GREEN}}: Oh... well anyways. \"I realise that, to express my great warning to my targeted reader audience, I am forced to use the same horrifying means.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"This is written in Forbidden Ink. A devilish substance that can be made from forced radioactive decay acceleration. In other literature, this process is euphemised as 'magically-enhanced purification of radioactive waste'.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"What exactly this ink is, that is yet to be understood. My guess, and great fear, is that the ink is concentrated {{CERTAINTY}}.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"When a radioactive material decays naturally, energy is not the only the only effect. The material also creates something, which I will refer to as {{CERTAINTY}}.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"The efforts in magical interference, driven by a desperate energy industry, takes more {{CERTAINTY}} than what nature can give, and from their efforts, this {{CERTAINTY}}-filled substance is materialised into Forbidden Ink. This ink is then diabolically commercialised as countless volumes of of books, most notably {{FUTURE}}.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"As the reader can see, the Forbidden Ink is only partly written by the author. The remaining part writes itself, depending on the current state of mind of the reader.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"Without scientific understanding of the underlying mechanics, whatever the reader sees in these books, turns out to really happen! Hence they are commercialised as fortune-telling books.\"
{{GREEN}}: Let's pause for a bit. I think I heard about these books before, but did you guys know this was how it worked?
{{RED}}: No...
{{YELLOW}}: Yes, actually! I bought one before.
{{RED}}: Please don't tell me you used it for winning a gamble against other students...
{{YELLOW}}: Aha... is it that obvious? Jokes on you all, because it worked.
{{GREEN}}: Anyways, let's continue. \"Yet, for a magi-scientist, fortune-telling is nonsense. The future can not be predicted, and if it would a price must have been paid. I have been searching for that price, the more I find out the more frightened I become.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"The Forbidden Ink does not predict a perceived future. In fact, the future does not exist yet! It is a misleading trick to say that one can read the future.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"A more correct view of the future is that is uncertain and undecided until we reach that point in time.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"From this view follows my first great warning: Reading The Forbidden Ink Destroys Any Other Possible Outcome Of The Future!\"
{{YELLOW}}: Oh, so that's how it worked? I would never have guessed, it really seemed like it just reads the future!
{{GREEN}}: Well, to me it seems like a matter of interpretation. Anyways...
{{GREEN}}: \"My first warning filled me with doubt, but only at first. To clear out the paradoxes of this statement, I attempted to undo the effects of the Forbidden Ink. This lead me to good news and very, very bad news.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"Let's start with the good: I was successful! The Forbidden Ink bounds the future. Destroying the ink with sufficient amount of energy seems to reverse the effects.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"From these results, I started to suspect that the unnatural creation of {{CERTAINTY}} is capable of neutralising the uncertainty of the future, which is why the possible outcomes of the future become more limited. It is as if reading the Forbidden Ink changes the state of an uncertain future, just like observing the Schödinger's Cat either keeps it alive or kills it.\"
{{GREEN}} is reminded of the robo-cat in their room.
{{GREEN}}: \"However, it was during such experiments that I discovered an appaling side-effect.\"
{{GREEN}}: \"This discovery forms my second, but even more frightening, warning: After The Future Given By The Forbidden Ink Is Read, The Alternative Outcomes Are Gradually Forgotten.\"
{{GREEN}} thinks for a moment.
{{GREEN}}: Could this be why we forgot about this study room? Were the books in the library sealing it away?
{{RED}}: Seems to be that way. Also, this could also be why none of us remembered the trapped students with the {{BLUE_ASPECT}} aspect here.
{{YELLOW}}: Unfortunately, we are still trapped. I already checked that.
{{GREEN}}: So there might be more books we need to burn! Anyways...
{{GREEN}} attempts to continue reading, but has a hard time finding the next sentence.
{{GREEN}}: Hold on, looks like the words are starting to escape me, quite literally.
Finally, {{GREEN}} finds a readable sentence. A sentence which {{GREEN}} remembers from before.
{{GREEN}}: Here it says... \"When the {{WISHMAKER}} weaves together the strings of {{CIRRUSENG}}, the fate of the new world has been set in motion.\"
{{GREEN}} remembers {{BLUE_TEACHER}} saying the exact thing when they first met.
{{RED}}: {{GREEN}}, is everything alright? I'm starting to sense a worrying energy around us.
{{GREEN}}: I'm ok, there might be more we can learn from this. Let's see... \"The {{WISHMAKER}} will enter the {{DUAL_SPACE}} when the secret of the {{IMAGINER}} is revealed\"
{{YELLOW}}: {{GREEN}}, that sounds too familliar for comfort...
{{GREEN}}: That just means we're close to the biggest secret! Let's continue... \"The {{WISHMAKER}} will discover the Forgotten Knowledge from the destruction of the {{SEAL}}. The {{WISHMAKER}} reads about their own future and ...\"
{{RED}}: {{GREEN}}, stop!
{{GREEN}} had already glimpsed the next words.
\"... becomes trapped in {{CIRRUSENG}}.\"
