	They go to the teacher, who is wearing what resembles a gymnastics suit and embraces the request with a energetic dance.
	{{RED_TEACHER}}: Now students, witness my devotion to the {{RED_ASPECT}} element!
	The fire next to {{GREEN}} intensified. A few seconds later, all other fire pits in the room also lit up at the same time. The room quickly became warm. {{GREEN}} looks around in awe.
