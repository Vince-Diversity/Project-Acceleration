This is the gymnastics hall. The orange walls are worn down, which is probably from self-defense arts training classes.
A crowd of loud students are neatly organized in lines, in front of our combat teacher, {{TEACHER}}.
- Join the line and wait for the class to start => start_class

~ visit

This is the gymnastics hall.
- Go back through the main hallway => goto_intersection

~ goto_intersection

{{GREEN}}'s team goes back through the main hallway.
set next = \"intersection\"

~ start_class

{{TEACHER}}: Alright younglings! In each house corridor, my colleagues await you!
{{TEACHER}}: You will be tested in your knowledge, skill and devotion.
{{TEACHER}}: House points will be delegated! Now go!
At the sound of house points, the other peers jumped. The rivarly between the houses is fierce, and the teachers are feeding this fire.
{{YELLOW}}: Yes! I've been itching for a competition! A triple hi-five for the best team in the universe!
{{RED}}: Hi-five!
We joined the noise and headed back through the main hallway.
do clear()
=> meeting_blue

~ meeting_blue
Admist the flowing crowd, {{GREEN}} noticed a boy who stood still in the corridor.
{{GREEN}}: You lost?
{{BLUE}}: Huh? How do you know that?
{{GREEN}}: In that case, why not follow us to the assignment rooms?
Having no reason to deny, {{BLUE}} joined the team.
