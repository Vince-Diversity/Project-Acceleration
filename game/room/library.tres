At the center of the library with multiple open floors. It is a quiet, echoing building of books, with creepy towering bookcases.
if blue_joined == true
	{{GREEN}}: We need to be quiet in the library, let's show you around.
	They walked around each floor. There are sections for all kinds of magiscientific knowledge. Anatomy and transformation, Alchemy and chemistry, Apparations and optics, Botanics and potions, Culture, Defensive arts, Economy, Ethics, Far-fetcheded arts, Foresight, ...
	{{GREEN}}: {{BLUE}}? Where did you go?
	{{BLUE}} was starting intensely on one of the editions of {{FUTURE}}.
	{{GREEN}}: I know there are awfully many volumes of {{FUTURE}}, but if you stare this hard you might make a hole in this book!
	Suddenly, the volume caught on fire!
	{{GREEN}}: Oh no, I was just joking!
	A moment later, the entire bookcase was on fire. It spread at an impossible speed and engulfed the whole floor before people started to notice.

			{{BLUE}}: {{GREEN}}? How did you get here?
			{{GREEN}}: Finally found you again, {{BLUE}}. I could ask you the same.
			{{BLUE}} is thinking about something.
			{{BLUE}}: I need to tell you something, but I do not think you will understand...
			{{GREEN}}: Is it not worth a try then? I will not judge.
			{{BLUE}} is thinking about what {{GREEN}} said, then nods.
			{{BLUE}}: Then I will tell you. This world, I think it is my imagination.
			{{GREEN}}: Do you mean strange extra dimension?
			{{BLUE}}: I mean everything. Even you. Somehow, I am walking in a world made from my own imagination...
			{{BLUE}} gives a concerned look.
			{{BLUE}}: Do you believe me?
			{{GREEN}} gave it a thought, but there was no doubt in mind at all.
			{{GREEN}}: Yes! of course I believe you.
			{{BLUE}} is shocked.
			{{BLUE}}: You... do? Why would you believe me, without proof?
			{{GREEN}}: I honestly do not know. You just seem to be the honest type to me. Right, {{YELLOW}}.
			{{YELLOW}} appears out of nowhere, as usual.
			{{YELLOW}}: Well... I do not want to break this jolly mood... But that is absolutely wicked!
			{{BLUE}} is shocked a second time. But {{BLUE}} still believes that the two have not fully understood. The books in the library reminds {{BLUE}}.
			{{BLUE}}: There is another issue. These books here, I think that they are inhibiting our ability to travel to the {{REAL_SPACE}}.
			{{BLUE}} points towards the many volumes of {{FUTURE}} on the bookshelf.
			{{GREEN}}: How do the books do that?
			{{BLUE}}: That, I actually do not know... I just hear my father's voice, telling me what to do.
			{{GREEN}} catches on.
			{{GREEN}}: I understand. We need firepower to get rid of the curse, right?
			{{BLUE}}: Yes, but also, an ordinary fire would not be enough. This requires a very powerful fire spell, and I can not cast a single spell at all.
			{{GREEN}}: Do not worry about it, I know someone very close who I am sure will help us... with a bit of trust.
			{{YELLOW}}: Woah, hold on a second. Am you two trying to get me involved in the library accident?
			{{GREEN}}: If you want. If you do not, I would understand.
			{{YELLOW}}: Are you out of your mind? This is too exciting to pass up on, of course I'm in!
			{{GREEN}}: Then we are all in agreement. For the fire spell, I was thinking of my friend {{RED}}, but currently we have the same problem as the students trapped here.
			There is a slight silence in the library.
			{{BLUE}}: I need to remember...
			{{GREEN}}: Is there something you are considering?
			{{BLUE}}: I am trying to remember events in this school. Maybe we could go back to that moment. Could you guide me to more places, {{GREEN}}?
			{{GREEN}}: Of course! Let's continue my introduction of the school to you.
