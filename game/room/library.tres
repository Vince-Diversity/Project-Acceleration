At the center of the library with multiple open floors. It is a quiet, echoing building of books, with creepy towering bookcases.
if blue_joined == true
	{{GREEN}}: We need to be quiet in the library, let's show you around.
	They walked around each floor. There are sections for all kinds of magi-scientific knowledge. Anatomy and transformation, Alchemy and chemistry, Apparations and optics, Botanics and potions, Culture, Defensive arts, Economy, Ethics, Far-fetcheded arts, Foresight, ...
	{{GREEN}}: {{BLUE}}? Where did you go?
	{{BLUE}} was starting intensely on one of the editions of {{FUTURE}}.
	{{GREEN}}: I know there are awfully many volumes of {{FUTURE}}, but if you stare this hard you might make a hole in this book!
	Suddenly, the volume caught on fire!
	{{GREEN}}: Oh no, I was just joking!
	A moment later, the entire bookcase was on fire. It spread at an impossible speed and engulfed the whole floor before people started to notice.

			{{BLUE}}: {{GREEN}}? How did you get here?
			{{GREEN}}: Finally found you again, {{BLUE}}. I could ask you the same.
			{{BLUE}} is thinking about something.
			{{BLUE}}: I need to tell you something, but I do not think you will understand...
			{{GREEN}}: Is it not worth a try then? I will not judge.
			{{BLUE}} is thinking about what {{GREEN}} said, then nods.
			{{BLUE}}: Then I will tell you. This world, I think it is my imagination.
			{{GREEN}}: Do you mean strange extra dimension?
			{{BLUE}}: I mean everything. Even you. Somehow, I am walking in a world made from my own imagination...
			{{BLUE}} gives a concerned look.
			{{BLUE}}: Do you believe me?
			{{GREEN}} gave it a thought, but there was no doubt in mind at all.
			{{GREEN}}: Yes! of course I believe you.
			{{BLUE}} is shocked.
			{{BLUE}}: You... do? Why would you believe me, without proof?
			{{GREEN}}: I honestly do not know. You just seem to be the honest type to me. Right, {{YELLOW}}.
			{{YELLOW}} appears out of nowhere, as usual.
			{{YELLOW}}: Well... I do not want to break this jolly mood... But that is absolutely wicked!
			{{BLUE}} is shocked a second time. But {{BLUE}} still believes that the two have not fully understood. The books in the library reminds {{BLUE}}.
			{{BLUE}}: There is another issue. These books here, I think that they are inhibiting our ability to travel to the {{REAL_SPACE}}.
			{{BLUE}} points towards the many volumes of {{FUTURE}} on the bookshelf.
			{{GREEN}}: How do the books do that?
			{{BLUE}}: That, I actually do not know... I just hear my father's voice, telling me what to do.
			{{GREEN}} catches on.
			{{GREEN}}: I understand. We need firepower to get rid of the curse, right?
			{{BLUE}}: Yes, but also, an ordinary fire would not be enough. This requires a very powerful fire spell, and I can not cast a single spell at all.
			{{GREEN}}: Do not worry about it, I know someone very close who I am sure will help us... with a bit of trust.
			{{YELLOW}}: Woah, hold on a second. Am you two trying to get me involved in the library accident?
			{{GREEN}}: If you want. If you do not, I would understand.
			{{YELLOW}}: Are you out of your mind? This is too exciting to pass up on, of course I'm in!
			{{GREEN}}: Then we are all in agreement. For the fire spell, I was thinking of my friend {{RED}}, but currently we have the same problem as the students trapped here.
			There is a slight silence in the library.
			{{BLUE}}: I need to remember...
			{{GREEN}}: Is there something you are considering?
			{{BLUE}}: I am trying to remember events in this school. Maybe we could go back to that moment. Could you guide me to more places, {{GREEN}}?
			{{GREEN}}: Of course! Let's continue my introduction of the school to you.

- Wait => wait_for_travel

~ burn

{{GREEN}} guides the team to the location of the volumes of {{FUTURE}}.
{{GREEN}}: This is where the fire started in our dimension. Is it ok if you could help us cast a fire spell here?
{{RED}} looks concerned.
{{RED}}: {{GREEN}}, can we pause for a bit? Do you know why we are doing this?
{{GREEN}}: Sort of. The students in this dimension seem to be trapped and {{BLUE}} told me that we need to do this.
{{RED}}: I don't know about that. Causing a fire is no small business and I have no understanding of how altering things here will influence reality. How sure are we about the consequences of this action?
{{GREEN}}: We do not have more information to go from, right?
{{YELLOW}}: Agreed. Sometimes, taking a chance is the only way to move forward!
{{RED}}: Is that it? I'm sorry, but I wouldn't trust a student I just met and just take a chance like this! This is far too rash of you.
{{BLUE}}: I understand why you are doubtful {{RED}}. All of this is just because of the voice of my father that I can hear, telling me that this is the right thing. If you think I am crazy, I would understand that...
{{RED}} takes a moment to think.
{{RED}}: While it is true that I am doubtful, I still want to help in this situation. However, as you should know {{GREEN}}, the energy that a {{RED_ASPECT}} mage can conjure diminishes very strongly when forced.
{{GREEN}}: I know that! Otherwise, I could have just suggested we time travel back if things go wrong.
{{RED}}: I'm sorry, but what? Are you suggesting that you can travel back in time too, now?
{{GREEN}}: Oh, did I forget to mention it earlier? I'm so sorry, I forgot to tell you about it! We escaped this dimension by going back through {{BLUE}}'s memories, and after that I also knew I needed you to come with us!
{{RED}} takes another moment to think about it.
{{RED}}: So am I correct if I say we only have two options now? Either, we act now, or we go back in time, somehow, to further contemplate on our actions.
{{YELLOW}}: Hold on, when did we start time-travelling? I have no recollection of that!
{{GREEN}}: You don't? That is strange, I still had my memories when I went back to the real world. {{BLUE}}, do you know why?
{{BLUE}}: No... I didn't even know you could enter this place to begin with...
{{BLUE}} looks for the cause, the mysterious creature floating above {{GREEN}}'s head might be a reason, but {{BLUE}} does not know how to explain that.
{{RED}}: Okay, so my second option is instead, that when we somehow go back in time, I will have forgotten that we entered this place. It would be as if I never knew that this even happened. Unless, I started to trust you more.
{{GREEN}}: I think so too. I might try to look around here again and try to find new evidence for building our trust for {{BLUE}} here. I feel obliged to continue trying, because I am your mentor, {{BLUE}}, and I promised to help you so that you can have a future in this school!
{{RED}} is reminded of what happened at the {{GREAT_HALL}}. The creature above {{GREEN}}'s head starts to shine and {{RED}} made a decision.
{{RED}}: You do not need to do that, {{GREEN}}, not anymore.
{{GREEN}}: Anymore? What do you mean...
Before {{GREEN}} had the chance to speak, the floor and bookcases start to shake violently. {{RED}} is gathering energy.
{{YELLOW}}: Yikes, you could have warned us.
{{RED}}: Get somewhere safe, now!
{{YELLOW}} took {{GREEN}} and {{BLUE}} to the entrance of the library instantly.
{{RED}} remembers {{RED_TEACHER}}'s voice, \"Show them your devotion!\", and engulfes the library in a great fire. Yet, {{RED}} controlled the fire skilfully.
{{YELLOW}}: This is so much energy! How is {{RED}} doing this? Who exactly is your friend, {{GREEN}}?
{{GREEN}} just watches the great display in awe. The burning is going much faster than naturally, it did not take long before all books have been turned into ash. As {{RED}} took care of the remaining smoke, {{GREEN}} sees that a door appeared in front of the entrance.
{{BLUE}}: Look! A door appeared!
{{GREEN}}: I had completely forgotten that there is a small study room there!
{{RED}} walks down to the entrance and notices the door.
{{RED}}: So did I. But I noticed some of the books had some strange effects to my spell. Perhaps those books were enchanted to seal away this forgotten door?
