	A tall brown room is found. Wide tables are spread and there are containers of blocks of different colours under each table.
	{{GREEN}}: This is the {{GREEN_ASPECT}} aspect's classroom. Students of this aspect learn how to make useful materials and shapes from standard raw materials.
	{{BLUE}}: Nods.
	{{GREEN}}: Since this is my born aspect, how about a little demonstration? Let me just ask teacher {{GREEN_TEACHER}} for permission.
	{{GREEN}} takes a moment to visit {{GREEN_TEACHER}}, who made a friendly gentle go-ahead gesture. {{GREEN}} takes {{BLUE}} to one of the tables.
	{{GREEN}}: So if I merge a small piece of this with some of that, and take a hair pin, I can get this.
	Mysteriously, the hair pin has a cherry flower on it. {{GREEN}} attaches it to {{BLUE}}'s hair.

{{GREEN}}: Excuse me, {{GREEN_TEACHER}}, could I ask you about the student which you assigned me?
{{GREEN_TEACHER}} gives an understanding response.
{{GREEN_TEACHER}}: What happened is unfortunate and beyond my understanding. I think you should meet the new student again.
{{GREEN}}: Do you know where {{BLUE}} is being under watch?
{{GREEN_TEACHER}}: If not in the {{GREAT_HALL}}, perhaps the office of the responsible watcher.
{{GREEN}} understands. {{BLUE}} might be in {{PRINCIPAL}}'s office.
{{GREEN}}: Thank you so much, {{GREEN_TEACHER}}.
