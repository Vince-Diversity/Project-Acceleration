A tall brown room is found. Wide tables are spread and there are containers of blocks of different colours under each table. At the end of a room, a wide-shouldered bold man is sitting, reading from one such book.

	{{GREEN}}: This is the {{GREEN_ASPECT}} aspect's classroom. Students of this aspect learn how to make useful materials and shapes from standard raw materials.
	{{BLUE}}: Nods.
	{{GREEN}}: Since this is my born aspect, how about a little demonstration? Let me just ask teacher {{GREEN_TEACHER}} for permission.
	{{GREEN}} takes a moment to visit {{GREEN_TEACHER}}, who made a friendly gentle go-ahead gesture. {{GREEN}} takes {{BLUE}} to one of the tables.
	{{GREEN}}: So if I merge a small piece of this with some of that, and take a hair pin, I can get this.
	Mysteriously, the hair pin has a cherry flower on it. {{GREEN}} attaches it to {{BLUE}}'s hair.
