I want to create stories. A game is a fun way to share stories. This website is for blogging about the progress I'm making.

The story is about a new student received by a delegated mentor, in a boarding school where magic and science coexist. But the new student goes missing in imaginary worlds. You follow the mentor's search in these imaginary worlds. The game is inspired by Yume Nikki, the dreamwalking game.
