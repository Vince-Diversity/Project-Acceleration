# Writing Dialogue

Navigate to the "Dialogue" tab in the editor.

![Dialogue tab](dialogue-tab.jpg)

Open some dialogue by clicking the "new dialogue file" button or "open dialogue" button.

## Nodes

All dialogue exists within nodes. A node is started with a line beginning with a "~ ".

![Node titles begin with a "~ "](node-title.jpg)

A node will continue until another title is encountered or the end of the file.

## Dialogue

A dialogue line is either just text or in the form of "Character: What they say". 

Dialogue lines can contain **variables** wrapped in "{{}}" (in either the character name or the dialogue). Any variables you use must be a property or method on one of your provided game states (see down below under **Settings, Runtime**).

![Dialogue lines](dialogue-lines.jpg)

Dialogue lines can also contain **bb_code** for RichTextEffects (if you end up using a `RichTextLabel` or the `DialogueLabel` provided by this addon).

If you use the `DialogueLabel` node then you can also make use of the `[wait=N]` and `[speed=N]` codes. `wait` will pause the typing of the dialogue for `N` seconds (eg. `[wait=1.5]` will pause for 1.5 seconds). `speed` will change the typing speed of the current line of dialogue by that factor (eg `[speed=10]` will change the typing speed to be 10 times faster than normal).

There is also a `[next]` code that you can use to signify that a line should be auto advanced. If given no arguments it will auto advance immediately after the text has typed out. If given something like `[next=0.5]` it will wait for 0.5s after typing has finished before moving to the next line. If given `[next=auto]` it will wait for an automatic amount of time based on the length of the line.

## Gotos

If you want to jump to another title then you can use a goto line. Assuming the target title is "another_title" your goto line would be 

```
=> another_title
```

If you wanted the dialogue manager to jump to that title but then return to this line when it is finished then you can write the goto line as:

```
=>< another_title
```

You can write what are effectively "snippets" of dialogue this way.

## Responses

To give the player branching options you can start a line with "- " and then a prompt. Like dialogue, prompts can also contain variables wrapped in `{{}}`.

![Empty prompts](empty-prompts.jpg)

By default responses will just continue on to the lines below the list when one is chosen.

To branch, you can provide and indented body under a given prompt or add a `=> another_title` where "another_title" is the title of another node. If you want to end the conversation right away you can `=> END`.

![Prompts](prompts.jpg)

If a response prompt contains a character name then it will be treated as an actual line of dialogue when the player selects it.

For example:

```
Someone: Here is a thing you can do.
- That's good to hear!
    Nathan: That's good to hear!
- That's definitely news
    Nathan: That's definitely news
```

...is the same as writing:

```
Someone: Here is a thing you can do
- Nathan: That's good to hear!
- Nathan: That's definitely news
```

## Conditions

You can use conditional blocks to further branch. Start a condition line with "if" and then a comparison. You can compare variables or function results.

Additional conditions use "elif" and you can use "else" to catch any other cases.

![Conditional lines](conditions.jpg)

Responses can also have conditions. Wrap these in "[" and "]".

![Conditional responses](conditional-responses.jpg)

If using a condition and a goto on a response line then make sure the goto is provided last.

## Mutations

You can modify state with either a "set" or a "do" line. Any variables or functions used must be a property or method on one of your provided game states (see down below under **Settings, Runtime**).

![Mutations](mutations.jpg)

In the example above, the dialogue manager would expect one of your game states to implement a method with the signature `func animate(string, string) -> void`.

There are also a couple of special built-in mutations you can use:

- `emit(...)` - emit a signal on your game states.
- `wait(float)` - wait for `float` seconds (this has no effect when used inline).
- `debug(...)` - print something to the Output window.

Mutations can also be used inline. Inline mutations will be called as the typed out dialogue reaches that point in the text.

![Inline mutations](inline-mutations.jpg)

One thing to note is that inline mutations that use `yield` won't be awaited so the dialogue will continue right away.

## Error checking

Running an error check should highlight any syntax or referential integrity issues with your dialogue.

![Errors](errors.jpg)

If a dialogue resource has any errors on it at runtime it will throw an assertion failure and tell you which file it is.

## Running a test scene

For dialogue that doesn't rely too heavily on game state conditions you can do a quick test of it by clicking the "Run the test scene" button in the main toolbar.

This will boot up a test scene and run the currently active node. Use `ui_up`, `ui_down`, and `ui_accept` to navigate the dialogue and responses.

Once the conversation is over the scene will close.

## Translations

You can export tranlsations as CSV from the "Translations" menu in the dialogue editor. 

This will find any unique dialogue lines or response prompts and add them to a list. If a static key is specified for the line (eg. `[TR:SOME_KEY]`) then that will be used as the translation key, otherwise the dialogue/prompt itself will be.

If the target CSV file already exists, it will be merged with.
