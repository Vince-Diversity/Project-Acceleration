# Introduction to reading the code

Each GDScript file is documented with the classes they instantiate into the game. For example, the [loader.gd](./loader/loader.gd) documentation references the [main_menu.gd](./loader/main_menu/main_menu.gd) and [game.gd](./game/game.gd) classes. Let's start from the `loader.gd` class.


## Loading and saving

The `loader.gd` is the main scene of this godot project. Some members are temporary during development. They are collected in `loader.gd` and tagged with `@experimental`. The `save_dir` member is a project folder, starting with `res://`, and will change to a default user data folder, `user://`, when releasing. This way, the save data can be changed manually when developing.

The save file is a godot resource file instance of the `SaveGame.gd` class. It contains the game version as an exported variable. Running a game on a save file with a different game version is probably not going to work.
