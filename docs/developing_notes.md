# Developing notes

Just some notes of obscure problems encountered during development
* To disable an Area2D, setting its monitororable property to false does not work. The player still sees the Area2D, for example, when Thing instances have their state switched to static state. And it only happens for one frame. And it doesn't seem to matter how many idle frames are skipped either... What works is setting the CollisionShape2D of the Area2D to disabled.
* With Dialogue Manager v.3.4.0, optional responses can't be hidden from the player. They're just not selectable. That is fine for now. A bad alternative is to use match statements and copying every previous response in every new case. But that won't work because visiting worlds is eventually going to be non-linear.
* To use the Revealer on something, the revealer has to use something from the interactable properties, like dialogue_id. But that means if the dialogue_id changes, the designer needs to add the Revealer to the new dialogue_id resource. That's not ideal but hard to avoid. The alternative would be to add a new Interactable property just for the Revealer, but that would have to change too many classes.
