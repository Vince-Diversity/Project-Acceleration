	After a bit of walking, some railtracks appear behind a hill. The train station is quiet.

	{{BLUE}} nods.

	{{BLUE}} steps out of a modern passenger train, onto an old-fashioned station in the forest. A student with long green hair notices {{BLUE}} and gives a friendly smile.
	{{GREEN}}: You are {{BLUE}}, right?
	{{BLUE}} nods.
	{{GREEN}}: Welcome! My name is {{GREEN}} and I will be your mentor during your first time at the magi-scientific boarding school. Please, follow me.
	{{GREEN}} takes {{BLUE}} over a passageway in the forest.
	set blue_joined = true
	{{GREEN}} looks at {{BLUE}}, a rather short and quiet new student.
	{{GREEN}}: Let's have an introduction. I study Materials and Creative Magic. I am born with the {{GREEN_ASPECT}} aspect. What are you going to study?
	{{BLUE}} looks around, as if they seem to have forgotten about something.
	{{BLUE}}: I am going to study Astrology. As for magical aspect... I do not remember what it is...
	{{GREEN}}: That's very curious! Do you know why?
	{{BLUE}}: I suppose I am simply not born with one.
	{{GREEN}}: So you are {{ASPECTLESS}}? I did not know there were people without magic. You're a very interesting student, {{BLUE}}!

No problems here.
